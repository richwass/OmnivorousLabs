      <h1>Built on Curiosity, Proven in Practice</h1>

      <p>Omnivorous Labs was founded by Rich Wasserman after 13 years at Amazon and leadership roles at Facebook/Meta, startups, and midsize tech companies. The insight: most consultants specialize in one methodology. The hardest problems don't respect boundaries.</p>

      <p>The name isn't just clever branding. It's a methodology: consume ideas widely - management science, academic research, operational experience - and synthesize them into practical, measurable outcomes.</p>

      <h2>The "Omnivorous" Approach</h2>

      <p>Most consultants are carnivores or herbivores. Excellent at one thing, limited when problems don't fit their menu. We're different. We pull from everywhere: Theory of Constraints for prioritization, OKR frameworks for goal-setting, frontline operational experience for execution, technical architecture for systems thinking.</p>

      <p>This breadth isn't dilettantism - it's pattern recognition. A logistics constraint applied to product development. A marketplace insight applied to internal operations. The best solutions come from unexpected places.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Rich Wasserman, Founder</h3>

        <p>I spent 13 years at Amazon in management roles, followed by 8 years across Facebook/Meta, startups, and midsize tech companies. I've led teams, built products, managed P&Ls, and cleaned up messes when things went sideways.</p>

        <p>My approach combines rigorous frameworks with hands-on experience. I write about OKR design, prioritization using Theory of Constraints, and organizational goal-setting at <a href="https://randomwalkthroughtech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Random Walk Through Tech</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Key frameworks & expertise:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Goal-setting:</strong> Shared vision, focused objectives (5 or fewer), measurable key results using controllable inputs</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Theory of Constraints - identify the single critical bottleneck, reduce focus to 1-2 priorities maximum</li>
          <li><strong>Execution:</strong> People-centric approaches that build trust and challenge assumptions with curiosity and tactical empathy</li>
          <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> 13 years at Amazon plus roles across company types and scales - big tech, startups, midsize companies</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>"More time up front → stronger/better/faster results"</em></p>

      <h2>Why Work With Us?</h2>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Proven Frameworks</h3>
          <p>Not generic best practices. Specific methodologies tested across Amazon, Meta, startups, and midsize companies. OKRs that work. Prioritization that identifies real constraints. Goal-setting that teams can execute.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Practitioner, Not Theorist</h3>
          <p>We've shipped code, managed budgets, led teams, and fixed broken processes. Theory matters - but only when it survives contact with reality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Intellectual Honesty</h3>
          <p>We'll tell you what we don't know. We'll challenge your assumptions (and our own). We optimize for the right answer, not the easy one. Never dictate the "best way" - let teams discover solutions.</p>
