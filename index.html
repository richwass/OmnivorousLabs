      <h1>Curiosity in. Clarity out.</h1>
      <p>Omnivorous Labs experiments broadly and delivers precisely - consulting, labs, and ventures that turn complexity into clarity.</p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Advise</h3>
          <p>Management and technical consulting for high-impact problems. We bring systems thinking, operational excellence, and decision quality.</p>
          <p>Company strategy, org structure, team dynamics - if you've got a problem worth solving, let's talk and figure out if we can help.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Experiment</h3>
          <p>Experiments, prototypes, and proofs of concept. We multitrack to learn fast and reduce risk before you scale.</p>
          <p>We'll tell you if you're working on the wrong thing. If it's not your real bottleneck, we'll say so—and point you to what actually matters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Build</h3>
          <p>Apps and tools that scale from experiment to product. We turn validated learning into real businesses.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="container section" id="why">
      <h2>Take in everything. Deliver what matters.</h2>
      <p>The word "omnivorous" means an appetite for everything. Most consultants specialize - they're the carnivores or herbivores of the business world, excellent at one thing but limited when problems don't fit their menu.</p>
      <p>We're different. We pull from everywhere: academic research, frontline operations, technical architecture, management theory, product design, organizational behavior. We synthesize what works, discard what doesn't, and deliver solutions that solve <em>your</em> problem - not just the problem we're good at solving.</p>
      <p>Think of it as a prism. White light enters - messy, undifferentiated, full of everything. The prism doesn't create the colors; it reveals what's already there, separating signal from noise. That's what we do: take in complexity, filter for what matters, deliver clarity.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container section" id="approach">
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p class="approach-tagline">Explore widely, filter ruthlessly, deliver measurably.</p>
      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Explore broadly</h3>
          <p>We're omnivorous in inputs: technology, management science, academic research, and boots-on-the-ground experience.</p>
          <p>The best solutions come from unexpected places - a logistics insight applied to product development, a marketplace pattern applied to internal operations. We look everywhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Filter the signal</h3>
          <p>Ideas are cheap.</p>
          <p>The right idea, at the right time, with the right constraints - that's valuable. We use first principles thinking and real-world constraints to separate signal from noise. What sounds good in theory but fails in practice gets cut. What's counterintuitive but works gets amplified.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3. Deliver outcomes</h3>
          <p>We don't do PowerPoint strategy. We deliver working prototypes, validated experiments, operational playbooks, and measurable results.</p>
          <p>The goal isn't a perfect plan - it's faster learning and de-risked decisions. We help you move from "should we?" to "here's what we learned" to "here's how we scale."</p>

    <section class="container section" id="who">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <div style="max-width: 780px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p>Omnivorous Labs is led by Rich Wasserman, who spent 13 years at Amazon and 8 years across Facebook/Meta, startups, and midsize tech companies. He's shipped code, managed budgets, led teams, and cleaned up messes when things went sideways.</p>
        <p>We're not theorists. We're practitioners who happen to read a lot. Our frameworks - OKR design, Theory of Constraints prioritization, people-centric execution - aren't borrowed from textbooks. They're tested across company types and scales, refined through hands-on experience.</p>
        <p>We're driven by curiosity, intellectual honesty, and the belief that variety makes solutions stronger. The world's most interesting problems don't fit into neat categories. Neither do we.</p>
